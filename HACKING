== HACKING

This document contains guidelines on how to contribute to this project.

== Dependencies

- Python 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6
- PHP 5
- Apache
- mod_rewrite (or compatible extension) 

== Coding Style

For Python, follow PEP 8, although I have a few requests.

- Use TABs for indentation, NOT spaces.
- Use CamelCasing for variable names, function names, class names, etc.
- Class names should start with an upper case letter, eg. ClassName not 
  className
- Variable and function names should start with a lower case, eg. pythonRocks 
  not PythonRocks

For PHP, HTML, and JavaScript, follow the same style as above.

Don't use crazy one-lines or anything. Make sure your code is readable and
documented.

==Repository

We use git as our VCS/SCM of choice. It allows for easy N-way merging and is
very fast at pulling repositories. If you would like to contribute, we have a 
public github repository at http://github.com/techwizrd/sketch
