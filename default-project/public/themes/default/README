This is the general README file for the theme. Structure this however you would 
like and write whatever you would like other people to read.

As a note to theme developers, try to put your images and css in this directory 
rather than in /public/images/ or /public/css/, as it allows for greater 
flexibility and easier customization of the site.

For instance, a dark colored site may oboviously have different images than a 
site made up predominantly of light colors. Also, Internet Explorer 6 (and to 
some extent 7) may need special images and css to deal with it's lack of 
standards compliance and inability to handle PNG transparency properly.

Another example: for mobile and handheld devices, you may want use simpler 
stylesheets and fewer, lower-quality images.
